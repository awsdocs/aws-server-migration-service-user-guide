**Product update**

As of March 31, 2022, AWS will discontinue AWS Server Migration Service \(AWS SMS\)\. Going forward, we recommend [AWS Application Migration Service](http://aws.amazon.com/application-migration-service) \(AWS MGN\) as the primary migration service for lift\-and\-shift migrations\.

You can initiate new migration jobs in AWS SMS until January 1, 2022\. Complete these active migration projects by March 31, 2022\. For more information, see [When to Choose AWS Application Migration Service](http://aws.amazon.com/application-migration-service/when-to-choose-aws-mgn/)\.
